# PbO-CCSAT: A Highly Configurable Stochastic Local Search Solver for Solving Propositional Satisfiability

PbO-CCSAT is a highly configurable stochastic local search solver for solving propositional satisfiability (SAT). We would like to note that PbO-CCSAT should be run on a operating system of `GNU/Linux (64-bit)`.
